# planner lane — pass 24 (main d502b78 unchanged; wip 0db1681 only touches generic_decide.py, which is the router lane; data-pipeline 0c1ca3d didn't touch this lane)

Pass 24: no new findings, and the open findings are unchanged.

Resolved: planner-23 on main (the volume fast path was dropped in the merge). 89 tests pass on main, including the planner-20 repro.

## Open P1 (ranked)
1. planner-24 P1 (main, new via PR #16) — calculator digits are sent as raw global `keys` after an unverified `open Calculator`, so they can land in the user's frontmost document — ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py L954-957
2. planner-6 P1 (main) — Premiere is still keyboard shortcuts only, with the 8766 bridge not connected — app/Sources/HandsKit/Skills.swift

## Highest-leverage next moves
- orchestrator._deliver_calc: replace the raw `keys` acts with `skill type_text text="<expr>="` (Calculator is a keystroke_app on main, so the target is checked and not_frontmost returned).
- planner.py: build OpConstraint at warmup (planner-25, P2).
- Copy reviews/planner/tests/test_planner20_done_reject_streak.py into ml/tests as a regression test.
- Premiere: add an expect to each premiere_command, or connect the bridge.
