# brain lane digest — pass 52 (2026-10-25T00:20:00Z)

Open: P0 0 / P1 8 / P2 8. main 8fb465c merged memory phase 1+2 (#50/#58, carries brain-42), architect-27 (#65), and serve now defaults to planner think 512/qwen. New memory WS frame: server runs it as a task (receive loop not blocked); Swift BrainFrames parses it. Suite on main: 18 failed / 1996 passed / 108 skipped (all MLX-stub). wip/local fe6c209 = main in lane.

## Open P0/P1 (ranked)
- brain-16 [P1] abs_level misreads times, durations, percentages and unrelated words — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@fb2cfd0@003d1bb)
- brain-17 [P1] Compound check runs serial route passes before speculative reuse — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@fb2cfd0@003d1bb)
- brain-35 [P1] Permission-prompt gate checks the pre-batch observation; a prompt raised mid-batch receives the next keys/type — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@dae4b26@?)
- brain-40 [P1] Final utterance reuses ARGS extracted from the uncased, unpunctuated partial — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@3772f7c)
- brain-42 [P1] Long-term person memory is a global DB shared by every Orchestrator — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@8fb465c via #58)
- brain-22 [P1] Planner history format conflict (runtime 'press #4 -> ok' vs examples '[ok] press #4') — `ml/src/brain/plan_bank.py` (main@27ebd13; cloud/planner-retrieval@9786fa4@dfb66a3)
- brain-41 [P1] ARGS decode cap of 24 tokens silently truncates free-text values — `ml/src/brain/decision.py` (main@2a2c2a9)
- brain-43 [P1] Unverified planner DONE accepted whenever the model verifier errors — `ml/src/brain/orchestrator.py` (main@0b83c3b via #54; cloud/planner-verify@484f5e7)

## Highest-leverage next moves
1. brain-42 (now on main): default to an in-memory long-term store, or give each HobbyLM/live case a fresh MUSELET_MEMORY_DB and WorkingMemory.
2. brain-43 (now on main): when _verify_done returns p_yes None, return 'unverified' (or retry once) instead of accepting a bare DONE.
3. brain-41 + brain-40: re-run ARGS on the final transcript for free-text skills, with a larger decode budget.
4. brain-27: confirm a grounded click whose target text names send/paper plane even without composer context.
5. brain-9 (brain-44): only take a browser name from an 'in/with/using <browser>' or 'open <browser>' phrase, not from the search query.
